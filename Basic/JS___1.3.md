### ✨ **1.3 Operators in JavaScript**  

Operators in JavaScript are symbols that perform operations on values and variables. They can be categorized into different types based on their functionality.

#### ➕ **1.3.1 Arithmetic Operators**  
Arithmetic operators perform basic mathematical operations:  

| Operator | Description  | Example  | Result  |
|----------|-------------|----------|---------|
| `+`      | Addition    | `5 + 3`  | `8`     |
| `-`      | Subtraction | `5 - 3`  | `2`     |
| `*`      | Multiplication | `5 * 3`  | `15`    |
| `/`      | Division    | `5 / 2`  | `2.5`   |
| `%`      | Modulus (Remainder) | `5 % 2`  | `1`     |

#### 📝 **1.3.2 Assignment Operators**  
Assignment operators assign values to variables.  

| Operator | Example | Equivalent To |
|----------|---------|---------------|
| `=`      | `x = 5`  | `x = 5`      |
| `+=`     | `x += 3` | `x = x + 3`  |
| `-=`     | `x -= 2` | `x = x - 2`  |
| `*=`     | `x *= 4` | `x = x * 4`  |
| `/=`     | `x /= 2` | `x = x / 2`  |
| `%=`     | `x %= 3` | `x = x % 3`  |

#### ⚖️ **1.3.3 Comparison Operators**  
Comparison operators compare two values and return `true` or `false`.  

| Operator | Description | Example | Result |
|----------|-------------|---------|--------|
| `==`     | Equal (loose) | `5 == "5"`  | `true`  |
| `===`    | Strictly Equal | `5 === "5"` | `false` |
| `!=`     | Not Equal | `5 != "5"` | `false` |
| `!==`    | Strictly Not Equal | `5 !== "5"` | `true`  |
| `>`      | Greater Than | `5 > 3` | `true`  |
| `<`      | Less Than | `5 < 3` | `false` |
| `>=`     | Greater Than or Equal | `5 >= 5` | `true`  |
| `<=`     | Less Than or Equal | `5 <= 3` | `false` |

---

#### 🔀 **1.3.4 Logical Operators**  
Logical operators are used to combine multiple conditions.  

| Operator | Description | Example | Result |
|----------|-------------|---------|--------|
| `&&`     | Logical AND | `(5 > 3) && (8 > 5)` | `true`  |
| `||`     | Logical OR | `(5 > 3) || (8 < 5)` | `true`  |
| `!`      | Logical NOT | `!(5 > 3)` | `false` |
